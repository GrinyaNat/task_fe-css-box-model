  <h1>Basic document flow</h1>

<p>
  I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on 
  <br>
  new lines below me.

</p>

<p>
  By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and we are as
  <br> 
  tall as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + padding
  <br>
  +border width/height.
</p>

<p>
  We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are
  <br>
  separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.
</p>

<p>
  Inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on
  the same line along with 
  <br>
  adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the same line. Overflowing inline 
  <br>
  elements will<span>wrap onto a new line if possible (like this one containing text)</span>,
  <br>
  or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do:
  <br>
  <img src="long.jpeg" alt="snippet of cloth" />
